Welcome to the research group website of AI Futures Lab at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). Our group's research focus in on understanding the cultural, creative, and computational futures of artificial intelligence. We bring together expertise in computational creativity, human-computer interaction, and cultural anthropology to investigate how AI shapes, and is shaped by, human practices, identities, and imaginations.

Led by Professor Gillian Smith and Professor Yunus Telliel, the AI Futures Lab is an interdisciplinary hub where engineers, artists, designers, and social scientists collaborate. We explore how AI can support creativity in crafts and games, how cultural narratives influence technology adoption, and how ethical, inclusive design can anticipate the social impacts of emerging AI systems.
