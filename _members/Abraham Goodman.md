I am currently a Masters student in the Interactive Media and Game Development program at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. I've always enjoyed math, and I've developed a love for programming as well. I love games, especially puzzles, and programming has fit right in with my love for problem solving. I've played a wide variety of puzzle games, and have started developing my own. I also enjoy speedrunning games and other more technical parts about them. I'm perhaps equally a fan of story as I am of puzzles. I love reading, and I love anime as a visual storytelling medium.
