I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computational Media at WPI, fully funded through research and teaching assistantships. Additionally, I am a fellow with FORW-RD---a research trainership program funded by the National Science Foundation that seeks to understand how robotics, A.I., and automation are changing the ways work is done. 

My research explores the tensions of generative AI as it intersects with creative domains, centering the priorities, processes, and motivations of artists. Particularly, I challenge dominant narratives of generative AI as a neutral and universal productivity enhancer, instead highlighting its interconnection in a broader ecosystem of labor, creativity, and other social and environmental concerns. This research centers ethical and creative inquiries of community practitioners, acknowledging that the interests of generative technologies do not always align with those of creativity and human expression.
