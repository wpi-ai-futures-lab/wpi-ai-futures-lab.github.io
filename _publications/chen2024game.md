Game companies and degree-granting colleges with game design programs create numerous games annually, with lessons learned from the development process holding significance for developers and game developer communities. Usually, game developers write postmortems to reflect on what went right and wrong in their game development process. Existing studies on video game postmortems have been primarily of games from professional studios that take years of development effort. Our work analyzes 36 student-created game postmortems spanning 9 years, all for mobile games shipped after 3-month development cycles in a summer internship program organized by the Massachusetts Digital Games Institute (MassDigi). We identify common themes and topics in these student postmortems and contribute to a greater understanding of student game-creation practices and project-based learning for game education.
