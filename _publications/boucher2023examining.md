This paper describes an in-progress research study that examines the perceptions and usability of generative AI (GAI) in the Summer Innovation Program (SIP)â€” a professional development program where teams of interns create mobile games in the Unity game engine over an 11-week period. GAI applications are being deployed across industries worldwide, but the impacts of using this technology in particular fields are relatively unexplored. The goal of this research study is to identify the potential harms and benefits of GAI in the games industry, with particular focus on how it impacts the creative processes.
