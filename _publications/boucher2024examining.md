This paper describes an in-progress examination of the differences in observed perceptions and usability of generative AI (GAI) in MassDigi’s Summer Innovation Program (SIP) from 2023 to 2024. SIP is a professional development program where teams of interns create mobile games in the Unity game engine over an 11-week period. Following a previous study using ethnographic methods to examine this topic in summer 2023, a similar study conducted in summer 2024 found dramatically different results. Where previously, interns broadly resisted the adoption of methods that incorporated GAI, the 2024 cohort was found to embrace the tools. This paper presents the differences in findings, explores possible explanations for these differences, and presents potential paths of research to further investigate the trajectory of GAI adoption amongst creative professionals. We also present four variables that may influence GAI adoption: experience, cultural context, proportion of artists within a community, and shifting societal paradigms.
