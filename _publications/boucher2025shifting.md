What is a roguelike? Many players ask this question and receive a common answer: a roguelike is a video game that includes procedurally generated levels and permadeath. However, this definition assumes a taxonomist paradigm, prioritizing what elements are present in a game rather than the question of why those elements are present. In this paper, we examine 1) the historical formation of the roguelike genre, 2) the creation of its namesake, Rogue, 3) the establishment of the genre’s first formal definition, The Berlin Interpretation, and 4) the gradual manifestation of The Modern Interpretation. Further, we present a new genre term—the Prepare to Die game, or PTD, defined by the question: what makes death meaningful in games? We argue that the commonly cited elements of procedurally generated levels and permadeath are merely tools to achieve variance in play and meaningful consequences for player actions. This shift in framing presents a holistic perspective that highlights experiential architecture and developer motivations, better aligning with the dynamic nature of genre. Further, we propose a descriptive set of vocabulary that can be used to craft inclusive genre descriptions that prioritize design philosophies shaping the very experience of video games.
