Wright’s notion of "organic creative space" invites viewers to experience the harmony and discord inherent when operating at the boundary between the natural and designed worlds. In this artwork, we interrogate similar boundaries: between the natural and artificial, and between the creative and the generative. We explore the use of artificial intelligence systems to generate images of natural phenomena–specifically, women’s faces–and the discomfort felt by viewers as they are unsettled by the unanticipated. The Matrix of Discomfort is a multimedia art installation that blends quilting and augmented reality (AR) to critically reflect upon AI as a medium that holds promise and distrust, and that exists at boundaries: between the natural and artificial, the creative and the generative, the digital and the physical. It reimagines the quilt, traditionally a feminized symbol of comfort and relaxation, as a canvas for stimulating conversation about the ethical quandaries and potential promises of generative AI.
