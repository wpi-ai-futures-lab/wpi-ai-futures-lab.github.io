Seeking to leverage Expressive Range Analysis (ERA)- a method of characterizing generative systems- for analysis of generative AI (GAI) systems and their outputs, this paper categorizes the approaches that have been used for ERA. We present a taxonomy with five axes of characterization that may be applied to ERA methodologies: content agnostic vs semantic; quantitative vs qualitative; product vs process; objective vs subjective; and automated vs manual. While ERA has traditionally been limited to the domain of Procedural Content Generation (PCG) in video game development, we recognize parallels between PCG and GAI and hope to see an expansion of the application of ERA into the domain of GAI. Serving this goal, these axes provide metrics through which to categorize, compare, and explore approaches.
