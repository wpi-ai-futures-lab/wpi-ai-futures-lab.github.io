Augmented reality (AR) allows the rendering of digital content on top of the physical space, which is a promising medium for tangible interaction. Marker-based AR is widely used thanks to its low cost and ease of integration, but the gameful aspect of manipulating the physical AR markers remains understudied. In this paper, we explored the stacking mechanics of transparent AR markers and described the creation of an AR music game called Stackable Music. Stackable Music can be developed, assembled, and set up at the home or office with a printer using several sheets of transparent film and a PC or mobile device with a camera.
