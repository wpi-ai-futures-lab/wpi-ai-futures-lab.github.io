Hi, I’m Tanya 👋🏽 I'm a senior at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, double majoring in Computer Science and Interactive Media & Game Development. I'm passionate about merging technical expertise with creative vision to bring bold ideas to life. My studies span software engineering, algorithms, 2D animation, graphic design, human-computer interaction, and more.
